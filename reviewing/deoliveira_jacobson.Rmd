## Summary

- Time preferences over outcomes for others is NB for policy
- Big research gap
- What about getting others to exert effort instead of you?
- Does *increasing* social distance affect the weight one gives to another's effort? 
- Or, does *decreasing* social distance remove information asymmetry about personal characteristics, such as (im)patience? 

## Main Results

1. "Law of Supply": Effort supllied increases with higher price for effort. 
2. Treatments consistent with now-versus-later at the extremes. 
3. Separate consideration of own vs. others w.r.t. minute rates (more at moderate rates). 
4. Separate pool into 0 vs. 60 minute choices: People choose 60 later for others much more often than for themselves. 
    - driven by strangers not friends

## Initial Comments

- Why the asymmetry of the task rates over 0.5 and 0.75, but increasing up to 4? 
    - e.g. if you're going up to 4, why not decrease to 0.25? 
    - Definitely not as symmetrical as Augenblick et al. 2015.
- Why did you not incentivize the beliefs about others and impatience?
    - Worry: survey responses differ from incentivized choices
- Why not have a treatment "Friend-Stranger"?
    - exclude 'own', just tradeoffs of others
    - disentangle even more the relationship between 'friend' and 'other'. 
    
##Initial Comments 2

- I was amazed at how low the rate of attrition was (3/110 subjects)
- Why do you assume people are never spiteful? 
    - Why don't I give you more time in the future for spiteful reasons? 
    - Plenty of evidence that people can be nasty (e.g. Abbink & Sadrieh, 2009, "The Pleasure of Being Nasty"; among others)
- What stops a subject from just sitting there and playing on their phone? (you answer this... ish)


##Comment: Pairing Data & Samples

- Friend data: are there differences in friend-Gender pairings and perceived differences in patience? 
    - e.g. M-M; M-F; F-M, F-F. 
- Slight confusion: I saw that 1 of 100 subjects exerted zero effort (p. 11)
- But you had 3/110 who didn't return... - And 5/63 completed zero in the return session; I wasn't sure how to add & compare these

## Comment: Friends vs. Strangers

- I wasn't sure from the paper, but I suspect that your questionnaire could have used a question like "How many people in the lab right now are you friends with?"
    - I'm concerned that 'strangers' may not actually be totally strangers, especially if subjects were asked "to bring friends to the lab"
    - therefore your estimates may *underestimate* the difference between actual strangers and others 
    - therefore perhaps provide a *lower bound*?
