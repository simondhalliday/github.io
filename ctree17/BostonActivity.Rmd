This activity is based on a series of labs I developed for an undergraduate research seminar on topics in housing economics at Carleton College. After reading "Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air" [@Harrison1978], students are asked to replicate some of the main results from the paper as well as two subsequent corrections applied by @Gilley1996.

In this activity we will see how R Markdown can be used to:

1. manage references (inline citations and references cited list creation)
2. include external images
6. create hyperlinks
3. produce nicely formatted tables from R output
5. generate hyperlinked footnotes
4. include inline R code
5. produce both .html and .pdf output documents

## Some Basic Results from @Harrison1978

Below are images of two tables of results from the @Harrison1978 paper:

* The summary statistics from Table V, and 
* The "basic equation" OLS regression results from Table VII:

## Accessing the Data

The dataset consisting of 14 variables across 506 census tracts is available in at least three different ways. 

1. @Belsley1980 (a book)
2. The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)
3. Within the Statistical Software R

For this exercise we will access the `Boston` dataset in the [`MASS` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/MASS.pdf). 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
str(Boston)
```

## Replicating the @Harrison1978 Results

Let's use the `stargazer` command from the `stargazer` package to calculate and present the summary statistics for the dataset.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(Boston, type = "text")
```

A comparison of Table V and the results above shows that some of the variables are not in the approporiate units to replicate the summary statistics. Let's use the `dplyr` package to create a modified dataset with renamed and appropriately rescaled values.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
# copy the data frame
boston.df.1978 = Boston
# change the names to uppercase for consistency with H&R (1978)
names(boston.df.1978) = toupper(names(boston.df.1978))

# now rescale and reorder for consistency
boston.df.1978 = boston.df.1978 %>% 
  # rescale 
  mutate(MV = MEDV*1000,
         Btransformed = BLACK/1000,
         LSTAT = LSTAT/100,
         NOX = NOX*10) %>% 
  # and reorder
  select(MV, RM, AGE, Btransformed, LSTAT, CRIM, ZN, 
         INDUS, TAX, PTRATIO, DIS, RAD, NOX, CHAS)

stargazer(boston.df.1978, 
          type = "text", 
          digits = 2)
```

That's better.[^1] Now let's estimate the OLS equation shown above. The `stargazer` command can also be used to produce a table of regression output.

[^1]: The original "Black" variable cannot be recovered from the these data, which have been transformed using the equation $(Black - 0.63)^2$.

```{r}
HR.lm = lm(log(MV) ~ I(RM^2) + AGE + log(DIS) + 
                      log(RAD) + TAX + PTRATIO + Btransformed +
                      log(LSTAT) + CRIM + ZN + INDUS + CHAS + 
                      I(NOX^2), 
                    data = boston.df.1978)
stargazer(HR.lm, type = "text")
```

Tweaking a few settings[^2] to customize our table shows just how similar our results are to the reported values.

[^2]: Check out this cheatsheet for the `stargazer` package: <http://jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer.html>
```{r}
stargazer(HR.lm, type = "text", 
          intercept.bottom = FALSE,
          keep.stat = "rsq",
          omit.table.layout = "n",
          report = "vct",
          digits = 5,
          no.space = TRUE)
```


## Data Problems

Nearly 20 years after the @Harrison1978 article, @Gilley1996 revealed that the underlying data used in the original analysis had two significant problems.

* There were data entry mistakes (eight dependent values appeared to have been entered incorrectly)
* Some dependent variable values were censored (census tracts with median home values above $50,000 were simply recorded as $50,000)

Two tables from  @Gilley1996 are shown below. TABLE I shows the data entry errors[^3], while Table III  presents three sets of regression results: the uncorrected OLS results, the Corrected OLS results, and a Tobit model.

[^3]: One of my students pointed out that there is a typo in the @Gilley1996 TABLE I. They believe observation 191 (rather than 119) should have a corrected median value of 33.0 (from an incorrect value of 37.0). The results shown in @Gilley1996 can be replicated when observation 191 is corrected but not when observation 119 is "corrected."

### Replicating the @Gilley1996 Uncorrected OLS Results
Inspection of the first column of results shows nearly identical values from our earlier regression. However, @Gilley1996 reports a constant term of 2.84853, whereas @Harrison1978 report a constant of `r coef(HR.lm)[1]`. Why the difference?

The answer is scaling (again!). Notably, @Gilley1996 present the median house value variable in $1,000s (i.e. 27.1 instead of $27,100). Let's rescale the dependent variable (and two others) and rerun the regression.

```{r}
GP.lm.Uncorrected = lm(log(MV/1000) ~  CRIM + ZN + INDUS + CHAS + 
                     I(NOX^2/100) + I(RM^2) + AGE + 
                     log(DIS) + log(RAD) + TAX + PTRATIO + 
                     I(Btransformed*1000) + log(LSTAT), 
                     data = boston.df.1978)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
stargazer(GP.lm.Uncorrected, type = "text",
          intercept.bottom = FALSE,
          keep.stat = "rsq",
          omit.table.layout = "n",
          report = "vct",
          no.space = TRUE)
```

### Replicating the @Gilley1996 Corrected OLS Results

Let's create a new variable, `CMV` for the corrected median values and see if we can replicate the other two columns from Table 3.

```{r}
obs.incorrect = c(8, 39, 191, 241, 438, 443, 455, 506) # note 191 instead of 119
correct.values = c(22.1, 24.2, 33, 27, 8.2, 14.8, 14.4, 19)

boston.df.1978 = boston.df.1978 %>% 
  mutate(CMV = MV/1000)
boston.df.1978$CMV[obs.incorrect] = correct.values
```

We now should be able to replicate the results from Column 2 in Table III simply by re-estimating the regression from column 1 but using `CMV` as the dependent variable.

```{r}
GP.lm.Corrected = lm(log(CMV) ~ CRIM + ZN + INDUS + 
                       CHAS + I(NOX^2/100) + I(RM^2) + AGE + 
                       log(DIS) + log(RAD) + TAX + PTRATIO + 
                       I(Btransformed*1000) + log(LSTAT), 
                     data = boston.df.1978)
```

### Replicating the @Gilley1996 Corrected Tobit Results

Let's just go ahead and estimate the Tobit model as well and present all three regressions in one table using `stargazer`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(AER)
GP.lm.Tobit = tobit(log(CMV) ~  CRIM + ZN + INDUS +
                      CHAS + I(NOX^2/100) + I(RM^2) + 
                      AGE + log(DIS) + log(RAD) + TAX + PTRATIO +
                      I(Btransformed*1000) + log(LSTAT),
                    right = log(50),
                    data = boston.df.1978)
```

```{r, results = 'markdown', warning=FALSE, messages = FALSE}
stargazer(GP.lm.Uncorrected, GP.lm.Corrected, GP.lm.Tobit,
          type = "text", digits = 5,
          intercept.bottom = FALSE,
          keep.stat = "rsq",
          omit.table.layout = "n",
          report = "vct",
          no.space = TRUE)
```

### Now you try

1. Add another image of the @Gilley1996 regression output table near our final replication table to make regression output easier to compare.
2. Change the necessary code to "correct" the observation presented in @Gilley1996 (observation 119 rather than observation 191). Observe that we now obtain different results in our final table of regression output.
3. Use inline code to show the reader the median house value for observation 119. 
4. Add the `stargazer` package to our references (you will need to look up the citation key in the `ReplicationBib.bib` file).
5. Change the output produced by this document from `html_notebook` to `pdf_document`
6. Produce a fancy `Latex` final table of regression results (now that you are generating a .pdf file). You will need to change the `type = "text"` option in the `stargazer` command to `type = "latex"` and also update `results = "markdown"` in the chunk option to be `results = "asis"`.
