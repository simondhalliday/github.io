## How we have used R Markdown

Michael: 

Senior thesis seminar with 9 students

* Very little background
* All stages in R Markdown
    + Data manipulation, visualization, analysis
    + Presentations 
    + Final paper

## How we have used R Markdown: Michael

Advantages: 

* To students
    + One environment for everything
    
* To me
    + Full reproducibility of all 9 papers (one award)
    + Much easier to reproduce in one document
    + Very professional appearance (with template)

Cost

* Somewhat higher startup cost in teaching them R and R Studio

## How we have used R Markdown: Aaron

* Create slides in an Econometrics course
* Final project in senior research seminar 
* Create custom progress reports for students
* Interactive shiny apps for micro students

## How we have used R Markdown: Simon

* A course in Behavioral Economics
* Slides, notes and assignments 
* Students do a reproducible research project
* They reproduce the results of a published paper and propose a new experimental design to test a new hypothesis



## R Markdown & Reproducibility 

- What happens in a traditional research report? 
- Are traditional research reports easily reproducible? 
- What gives us *soup to nuts* reproducibility? 
  - Answer: R Markdown or Scripted LaTeX + STATA (StatTag?)
- Works within the TIER framework
- I've implemented a variation of this in an upper-level economics elective


## Traditional Reports

<div class="col2">
```{r, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Courtesy of Bray, 2016"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/tradreport.png")
```

The Good 

- familiar format, e.g. Word 
- easy learning curve

The Bad

- tough for reproducibility
- difficult to update
- mistakes crop up
- teams can't collaborate easily

The Ugly? 

- Word/GDocs = Ugly?

</div>

## R Markdown Report/Notebook? 
<div class="col2"> 
```{r, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Courtesy of Bray, 2016"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rmd_struct.png")
```


The good

- easy to reproduce
- easy to edit/update 
- easy to collaborate
- standardized & fast

The bad

- students must learn syntax
- error-free to compile

The ugly? 

- inequality in student backgrounds

</div>


##Text Formatting

    
    # Header 1

    ## Header 2

    ### Header 3

    This is normal sized text used in the body of our work. 

    For bullet points, we use dashes, e.g. 

    - Intro to RStudio
    - More content
      - a sub-point
    - Back to the original level
    

## Document Types

R Markdown can produce a variety of document types (other than the default `html` page):

*   `pdf_document` makes a PDF with LaTeX (`.pdf`)
  
*   `word_document` for Microsoft Word documents (`.docx`).
  
*   `odt_document` for OpenDocument Text documents (`.odt`).
  
*   `rtf_document` for Rich Text Format documents (`.rtf`) 
  
And others. 

## Presentation Types

R Markdown can also be re-purposed to produce a presentation file (as with this presentation):

*   `io_slides` opens in your browser and interactive (`.html`)
  
*   `slidy` another browser based presentation format (`.html`)
  
*   `beamer` makes a PDF with LaTeX (`.pdf`)
  

## Data work
Think about data analysis as falling into three loose categories: 

- management & wrangling
- visualization & summary statistics
- modeling & inference

All of this occurs in the code "chunk"

##Code chunks

- To open a code chunk hit CMD + OPTION + I on a Mac  

- Or type out three backticks ``` folowed by {r} 

- And then three more back ticks ``` on another line. 

- Within the {r} you can specify options, like {eval = FALSE} if you don't want it to evaluate the code

- Or you can label the code chunk, e.g. {r cars} labels the chunk "cars" in your ToC

## Code Chunk: Example 
<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

The option `echo = TRUE` means that the code gets included in the rendered html. 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```



## Slide with Plot (Reproduction of Sutter, 2009)

```{r Sutter Data, echo = FALSE}
SutExp <- read.csv("sutterexperiment.csv")
SutExp <- 
  SutExp %>% 
  rename(session = Session, subject = Subject, r1 = R1, r2 = R2, r3 = R3, r4 = R4, r5 = R5, r6 = R6, r7 = R7, r8 = R8, r9 = R9, treatment = Treatment)

```

```{r summary data, echo = FALSE}
groupAves <- 
  SutExp %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(r1 = mean(r1), r2 = mean(r2), r3 = mean(r3), r4 = mean(r4), r5 = mean(r5), r6 = mean(r6), r7 = mean(r7), r8 = mean(r8), r9 = mean(r9))
```

```{r narrow data}
narrowAve <- 
  groupAves %>%
  gather(round, average, r1:r9)
```


```{r plot1}
Plot1 <- 
  narrowAve %>%
  filter(treatment == "individual" | treatment == "teamtreat" ) %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  arrange(treatment)
Plot1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = round, y = average, color = treatment)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = treatment)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = treatment)) + 
  ylim(20, 80) +
  xlab("Round") +
  ylab("Average amount allocated") + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = seq(1, 9, by = 1)) +  
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Treatment",
                         breaks = c("individual", "teamtreat"),
                         labels = c("Indidividuals", "Teams")) +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "Treatment",
                         breaks = c("individual", "teamtreat"),
                         labels = c("Indidividuals", "Teams"))
```

##Dynamic Graphs 

```{r dygraph, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
Participation <- read.csv("Data/labor_force_participation.csv")
Partdate <- as.Date(Participation$date)
MaleP <- xts(Participation$male, Partdate)
FemaleP <- xts(Participation$female, Partdate)
LFPR <- cbind(MaleP, FemaleP)
colnames(LFPR) <- c("Male", "Female")
dygraph(LFPR, main = "Labor Participation Rate Over Time") %>%
       dySeries("Male", label="Male")%>%
       dySeries("Female", label="Female")%>%
       dyAxis("x", label="Date")%>%
       dyAxis("y", label="Labor Force Participation")%>%
       dyHighlight(highlightSeriesOpts = list(strokeWidth = 3), 
                   highlightCircleSize = 4)%>%
       dyRangeSelector()
       #dyOptions(drawGrid = input$showgrid, 
                 #colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Set2"))
```


##Plotly Graphs

```{r ancona, echo = FALSE}
AnconaBase <- read.csv("Data/ancona.csv")
Ancona <- 
  AnconaBase %>%
  rename(date = dTransDataVendita, 
         productid = iProdID, 
         productdescription = vchClasseProdottoDescrizione, 
         speciesname = vchSpecieDescrizione, 
         quantity = nTransQuantita, 
         unitprice = nTransPrezzoUnitario, 
         saleprice = nTransPrezzoVendita, 
         finalprice = nTransPrezzoFinale, 
         producerid = iProduttoreID, 
         qualityid = iQualitaID, 
         qualitydescription = vchQualitaDescrizione,
         caseid = nNumCasse)
AnconaAve <- 
  Ancona %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(price = round(mean(unitprice), 2), 
            meanquantity = mean(quantity), 
            quantity = round(sum(quantity), 2))
```

```{r plotly Ancona}
AnconaPlot <- 
  AnconaAve %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = quantity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, method = "lm") +
  xlab("Daily average price per kilogram (Euros)") +
  ylab("Daily quantity (kilograms)") +
  coord_flip() +  
  theme_bw()
  #theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10), 
        #plot.margin=unit(c(2,1,1.5,2),"cm")
#)
ggplotly(AnconaPlot, width = "640", height =  "480")
```

##Alter and check some data
```{r create uniqid}
SutExpUniq <- 
  SutExp %>% 
  mutate(uniqid = paste(session, treatment, subject, sep = "_"))
head(SutExpUniq)
```

## Statistical Tests

```{r}
SutNarrow <- 
  SutExpUniq %>%
  gather(round, value, r1:r9) %>%
  arrange(session, subject, treatment, team)
Plot1data <- 
  SutNarrow %>%
  filter(treatment == "individual" | treatment == "teamtreat" )
wilcox.test(value ~ treatment, data = Plot1data)
```




## Regression output 

```{r}
m1 <- lm(value ~ treatment, data = SutNarrow)
summary(m1)
```

##Or a Panel Regression
```{r}
m3 <- plm(value ~ treatment, data = SutNarrow, index = c("uniqid"), model = "random", effect = "time")
summary(m3)
```

## Even Fancy Regression Output 
```{r, results = "asis"}
stargazer(m1, type = "html", 
          no.space = TRUE,
          keep.stat = c("n", "rsq"),
          omit.table.layout = "n")
```


##Math? 
How about Bayes' Rule? 

$$Pr(\mbox{Outcome} | \mbox{signal}) = \frac{\theta p}{\theta p - (1 - \theta)(1 - p)}$$

R Markdown uses $\LaTeX$ for math and it immediately gets displayed in R Studio.  

That is, $\LaTeX$ without the challenges of learning the packages, tables, etc that makes learning $\LaTeX$ so hard.

In-line equations are bracketed by single dollar signs `$`. 

Off-set equations are bracketed by double dollar signs `$$`. 
##What else? 
R Markdown and R Studio together have excellent capabilities. 

- R Studio can show you the output of the commands *within* the R Markdown file
- R Studio has *error-detection* and *debugging* assistance for your code (unlike, e.g. STATA or aspects of Excel)
- R Studio server can be hosted online and your students work with logins there

## Lessons from experience

Michael:

Students will only learn commands through graded assignments 

Aaron:

Students can struggle with basic computing (working directory, etc.)

## Lessons from Simon
Students have to adjust to getting the Basics Right

- File paths - many students haven’t had to specify a file path before (``drag-and-dropitis'') (initial inequality in baselines can be tough)
- Difference between a script (.R file - like a .do file) and a markdown document/notebook (.Rmd) (medium adjustment)
- Difference between the .Rmd and the exported file: pdf, html, etc (quick adjustment)

Students like (or are used to) WYSIWYG, which Rmd is not
 - Students are accustomed to MS Word & G docs which are WYSIWYG, but RMD is not. 

Installing packages

- analogy: you have to install apps (packages) to do different things on your (RStudio & R)
- Chrome extensions

Server = GOOD
