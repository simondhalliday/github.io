Here you'll find  the content [Simon Halliday](https://simondhalliday.github.io), [Michael O'Hara](https://github.com/michaeleohara/) and [Aaron Swoboda](https://aswoboda.github.io/) covered during the "Efficient Empiricism" workshop, 1 June 2017. 

#Outline

- Start with a presentation by the presenters on R Markdown and some of the uses of R broadly. 
- Progress to collaborative lab exercises and activities that employ R Notebooks (.Rmd). 
- We conclude with a reflection & FAQ

#How do I access RStudio? 

- Connect to the WestinMeetingRooms wireless using password ctree2017
- Go to the following url: [104.236.95.197/rstudio](http://104.236.95.197/rstudio)
- Use the login credentials that we have provided for you to log in. 
- If we need more logins... we'll sort you out.
