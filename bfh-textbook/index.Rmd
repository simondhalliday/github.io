## Introduction
```{r cccbook, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "Provisional Cover", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/bfh_cover.jpg')
```

[Samuel Bowles](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/), [Duncan Foley](https://sites.google.com/a/newschool.edu/duncan-foley-homepage/home) and I (Simon Halliday) have an ongoing joint project writing an intermediate microeconomics textbook: *Coordination, Conflict and Competition: A Text in Microeconomics* (henceforth CCC). On this site, you will find preliminary content that we are providing to test-teachers who are planning to use draft chapters of the book as well as tips and pointers to do with teaching the book. 

```{r teampic, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "Simon, Sam and Duncan at SFI, Summer 2015", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/bfh_team.jpg')
```

If you wish to sign up to be a test-teacher of the book (or even just a test-reader), then please provide your details in the following Google form so that we can gather your details. (If you're unable to see the embedded form below, then please click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MX3F0zZ41SGY5s3z2qrnmt9BEZa-x2x2yp9JlcdAH-w/viewform)).

We believe the book is now ready to be taught by other professors, especially those interested in how economics has changed over the past thirty years. Once you have reviewed chapters of the book we'll ask you provide feedback to us in another Google Form (to be provided later). 

##What are the flavors and themes of CCC?
```{r fig-margin2, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MBIE, 2006, PUP", fig.width=1, fig.height=1, cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/mbie.jpg')
```
CCC has a strong flavor of Sam's graduate-level textbook, [*Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution*](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7610.html) published by Princeton University Press in 2006. As an advanced text, though, it is not suitable for many undergraduate classes because of the high level of the math and certain other aspects of its theoretical rigor. 

```{r fig-margin3, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/logo-red-black.png')
```

CCC would also be an excellent follow-up text for introductory economics courses that use the Curriculum Open Access Resource in Economics ([CORE Project](http://www.core-econ.org/)) directed by [Wendy Carlin](http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/). CORE is based on many similar themes to CCC.  

It could also serve as a follow-up to other texts, such as the following (though the match would not be as good as with CORE). Different courses would also emphasize the mathematics to a greater or lesser extent.  

- Frank and Bernanke, *Principles of Economics*, 5th Ed, McGraw-Hill. 
- Bowles, Edwards and Roosevelt, *Understanding Capitalism*, 3rd ed, Oxford University Press. 
- Goodwin, Harris, Nelson, Roach and Torras, *Principles of Economics in Context*, Routledge. 
- Krugman and Wells, *Microeconomics*, 3rd edition, Worth Publishers. 
- Cohen, *Microeconomics for Life*, 2nd edition, Pearson Canada. 

Here is a non-exhaustive list of important themes in the book: 

- *rents*: gains from trade or rents are produced by social interactions - rents are the benefits obtained by those engaged in social interactions; rents can come from voluntary exchange, or from two neighbors deciding to irrigate their farms
- *evidence*: economics is an empirical science that relies on rigorous experiments -- from the lab and the field -- and survey and other data to test its theories; theories that don't conform to the data can be revised when confronted with the data and with new ideas that come about from seeing how people, organizations, and economies behave
- *institutions*: institutions can be laws, norms, and equilibria of games; they affect how social interactions unfold and who gets what and why
- *inequality & power*: social interactions create rents, but who gets what share of the rents depends on institutions and history; often institutions can produce unequal outcomes when one person has power over another
- *preferences, beliefs and constraints*: people have preferences and beliefs about the world, and they are held back from getting what they want by the constraints -- legal, material and ethical -- from achieving what they want
- *diversity of preferences*: self-interest, altruism, reciprocity, norms, and process-dependent preferences all exist in the wild and affect how social interactions unfold and which equilibrium, among many, people might choose
- *external effects*: positive and negative external effects ("externalities") pervade social interactions and people and firms routinely make decisions that affect how well or poorly their counterparts will do; as a result, outcomes are *interdependent*

##Contents
Below is an abridged table of contents for the first 12 chapters of the book. Currently the first ten chapters are available for distribution with chapters 11 and 12 under active revision over the summer. We plan to have a final part, Part 3, which will go into greater depth on advanced topics, such as the fundamental welfare theorems (and criticisms thereof) and a final reflection on the institutions of capitalism. You can access a more comprehensive draft table of contents [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9jjwkjdUJU7R1hnZ25UWTJTYWc/view?usp=sharing) and a copy of the preface [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9jjwkjdUJU7dGViNm1MNm15NXc/view?usp=sharing).

##Calculus and Graphics
We use calculus in the book, but almost all of the calculus is contained in boxes (named for Alfred Marshall as you will see). We try to follow Marshall's maxims with the mathematics:  

```{marginfigure}
Alfred Marshall, 1906, Letter to Arthur Lyon Bowley. Collected in A. C. Pigou, 1966, *Memorials of Alfred Marshall*, pp. 427-428.
```
"I had a growing feeling in the later years of my work at the subject that a good mathematical theorem dealing with economic hypotheses was very unlikely to be good economics: and I went more and more on the rules

1. Use mathematics as a shorthand language, rather than an engine of inquiry. 
2. Keep to them till you have done.
3. Translate into English. 
4. Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. 
5. Burn the mathematics. 
6. If you can't succeed in (4), burn (3). 

This last I did often."

We may not have burned as much of the mathematics as we ought to have done, but we try to restrain the mathematics to when it is most necessary. For the most part, the economics is conveyed through *graphical* intuition accompanied by algebra. All of the graphics are also available on github (see Simon Halliday's github repo [bfh-textbook](https://github.com/simondhalliday/bfh-textbook/). We hope later to provide interactive versions of the majority of the important graphics programmed either in R with Shiny or Mathematica.   

##Course Materials
Once we have provided you with draft chapters of the book, I will share a Google drive folder with you that contains slide decks, problem sets, quizzes, worksheets, etc. I have test-taught the book at Smith College and much of this content is based on the course I have taught along with content that Duncan Foley has used when teaching at [Eugene Lang College](http://www.newschool.edu/lang/) (the undergraduate liberal arts college attached to the New School for Social Research). We are also working with two RAs over the summer to provide additional content before fall 2016 (e.g. the quizzes explained below). 

##Quizzes
We will be providing access to multiple choice and checkbox quizzes for each chapter which we hope to have for each chapter after the summer. They will use the new Google Quiz interface. Either our RA or I will provide access to the quiz, which an instructor will then be able to duplicate and edit for use with their own classes. Though Google quizzes are not yet as powerful as quizzes on Moodle, Blackboard or Sakai (for example, Google quizzes currently lack $\LaTeX$ integration for mathematical questions), their portability and ease of use suits our needs well for the moment; especially until we have completed negotiations with publishers.  

##Flashcards
The book has a glossary with all the definitions used in the book. Over the next academic year we hope to turn the definitions into a set of flashcards using [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/). Anki is an open-source flash-card service where the desktop and web-interfaces can be used free of charge, as can the Android app. But, the iOS app version needs to be bought for a fee of $25. As the web interface and desktop versions are free of charge and the notebooks are exportable to other formats, we still think it is the best current option. You will be able to import the flashcard decks to your Anki app when these are made available. They will be provided chapter-by-chapter over AY2016-17. 

##Pedagogical Approach
Our approach is informed by the latest ideas in the learning sciences. 
```{marginfigure}
See, for example, Brown, Roediger and McDaniel, 2014, *Make It Stick*, Harvard University Press/Belknap Press, Cambridge, MA. 
```

- With our quizzes, we recommend regular *testing* to improve learning and retention; students obtain immediate feedback and the instructor can respond to student needs
- With in-class worksheets and think-pair-share exercises enabled by the worksheets, students again get *immediate feedback* and can learn by teaching each other
- We *interleave* the use of economic jargon throughout the book -- students learn a core set of economic ideas and apply them to a diverse array of problems 
- We recommend that instructors *space out practice* using the quizzes, problem sets and worksheets
- Attempting a problem *before knowing a solution* provides learning benefits (even when getting to an incorrect solution initially) 
- *Varied* practice is important to learning, which again motivates our use of the different types of testing and learning work (quizzes, worksheets, problem sets)
```{marginfigure}
*Elaboration* is " the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know." (Brown, Roediger and McDaniel, 2014, p. 5)
```
- I also ask students to engage in a practice where I distribute index cards and students write 3 ideas they remember from the previous class and to explain them in their own words (for a Monday class recalling a Friday class this is particularly useful). I have found this practice to be useful because it involves both practising *recall* and *elaboration*.
