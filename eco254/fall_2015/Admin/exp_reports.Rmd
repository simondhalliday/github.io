Here are some pointers on writing your experimental reports. 

Length

- about 2 typed pages, i.e. about 500 words

Contents

- describe what you thought about the experiment 
- discuss why you made the choices you did after completing the instructions, during the actual rounds of the experiments and then after the experiment was completed and you have had some time to think about it
- reflect on the results of the experiment (the aggregated results from the experiment)
- consider whether the standard behavior the experiments looks rational or consistent with the prediction you anticipate you would see in the model
- explain whether you think the model is missing something if it fails to match the behavior in the experiment  
- think critically about your own behavior and decide whether you think you could have done better had you altered your strategy. 

Keeping track of your experience and understanding will help us to discuss why the results from experimental sessions differ from what we might predict from theory.
