##Structure of your project
The project should contain the following important elements: 

1. Introduction (1/2 page to 1 1/2 pages) 
    - mention the paper & its main results
    - discuss the success & failures of your reproduction 
    - highlight some of the literature you introduce 
    - propose your new *question* and the experimental/survey design you will
    use to answer the question. 
2. Summary of the your main paper (1 1/2 to 3 pages)
    - explain the main arguments of the paper
    - explain the main methods (experiment/survey, etc)
    - discuss the paper's conclusions
3. Reproduction of the results from your paper (however many pages it takes). 
    - Do this in the order the results appear in the paper and structure them 
    in the same way that the paper does. Your results do not have to be as 
    *pretty* as those in the original paper; I mainly want you to emphasize 
    substance not presentation (if you have time at the end to think 
    about presentation, great, but don't worry too much about this). 
    - If your results *differ* relative to your paper's results, then think
    about *why* you might find differences (did you specify something 
    differently in a regression, is your sample size different to what they
    report, etc)
4. Literature review of papers relating to your new design (2-3 pages)
    - review some of the main literature that motivates your new design
    - highlight the *gap* in the literature that your design will exploit
5. Experiment/Survey Design (however many pages it requires; though some will go in an appendix, e.g. experimental instructions)
    - A description of the experiment/survey design you would use to answer
your question (specified in the intro) 
    - A discussion of the statistical and graphical analysis that you would use 
    to examine the data and assess the results 
    - Explain the main predictions that you would make with the relevant theory
    (re: your lit review) and what you might do to test the theory.
6. Conclusion (1 to 2 pages)
    - What did you find and how much were you able to confirm/fail to confirm? 
    - What would your design add to the literature, add to our understanding, or change/improve existing theory if we had the results?
    - What future paths of research would you recommend? 

##Ideas
If you're in a particular group, I would recommend that *before* you look in journals you open a scratch document where people can brainstorm ideas that they're interested in. 

## Journals
For your projects, you should look mainly at journal articles. There are a variety of really good journals that deal with topics in experimental and behavioral economics. Some of the journals are "general interest" journals where they will have the occasional paper on behavioral economics, others are more focused on topics related to behavioral economics. 

Before doing anything else, I recommend that you use google scholar: [scholar.google.com](http://scholar.google.com) to do searches for academic papers that involve the topic you are interested in. Use relevant keywords.
