Professor: Simon Halliday

##Week 8 

###Thursday 29 October

- You can look at all the steps we'll take with the Sutter data here: 
[http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis_2](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis_2)
 - We will look at the Wilcoxon test on Thursday as well as the a first attempt at a multiple regression model (my notes may change between now and then)
 - We shall complete Chapter 5 (leaving out signalling games)
 - Remember, I announced that we'll exclude Ch. 6 and skip to Ch. 7
 
 
###Tuesday 27 October

- Be sure to have gone through the ggplot exercise that we started on last week Thursday. 
- You can see my 'readme.txt' file here: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/readme.txt](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/readme.txt)
- You can see a step-by-step completion of the first part of the exercise in R here: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis)
- Once we've completed this exercise, I'll get started on Ch. 5 of Cartwright. 
- Then we'll spend a bit of time on group-work too. 

`ggplot` exercise continued: 

- you're first going to need to make the data narrow using a key-value pair
- you'll then need to filter out data that you don't need for the first graph in the paper (i.e. you only want "teamtreat" and "individuals")
    - to do this, you'll need to use "logical operators". 
    - A logical operator is like an "and" sign "&"" or an "or" sign "|"
    - you'll need to use or "|" because you'll want to *keep* those observations in "teamtreat"" or "individual"
- once you've filtered out the treatments you don't need, you can construct the ggplot code

Other Notes: 

- Check here for the notes on Bayes' Rule and understanding expected utility changes: [simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/bayes_rule/bayes_rule](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/bayes_rule/bayes_rule)

##Week 7 
###Thursday 22 October
We will talk about the following topics in R today: 

- Wide vs. Narrow data: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46463](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46463)
- Joins: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46462](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46462) 
- `group_by` and `summarise` see here: [http://dtkaplan.github.io/DCF-2014/CourseNotes/BasicDataCommands/DraftNarrative.html](http://dtkaplan.github.io/DCF-2014/CourseNotes/BasicDataCommands/DraftNarrative.html)
and here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46744](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46744)
- We will spend time on the team projects (we didn't have time for this on Tues) 

- I want you to emphasize the following steps: 
    - making sure you have *data* to work with (to bring to later Thursday sessions) 
    - deciding on the literature with which your project fits to produce a *literature review*
    - (much later) thinking about the ways in which you can alter/improve on the existing experiments/surveys to improve our overall knowledge

Notice, that once we have covered this content, we will have moved up to about Ch. 11 in *Data Computing*. I recommend that you read Chs. 9 through 11 if you want to keep up. 


####ggplot Exercise
We are going to do an exercise where we use ggplot to try to reproduce at least one graphic from a published paper. The paper is: 

- Sutter, Matthias. 2009. "Individual Behavior and Group Membership: Comment." American Economic Review, 99(5): 2247-57.
- download the paper from Moodle here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46730](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46730)
- see the paper's page at the AER here: [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.99.5.2247&fnd=s](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.99.5.2247&fnd=s)
- download the data on Moodle here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=46728](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=46728)
- see the online appendix for the paper here: [https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/feb2013/20101542_app.pdf](https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/feb2013/20101542_app.pdf)

Working with the data: 

- You will notice that the data is *not* glyph-ready and it also isn't that tidy. 
- Ideally, we would work with the spreadsheet as is and import it into R. We're not going to do that, but will create different spreadsheets with different data and *then* import them into R. 
- Check out the Tier protocol for suggestions. 
- Put the original data in an 'original data' folder. 
- Then create a folder with 'Working data' 
- We will use the data in working data and document what we do in a readme.txt file. 

Also, check out these links for behavioral econ in the press:

- Cass Sunstein reviews Akerlof and Shiller's *Phishing for Phools*: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/oct/22/why-free-markets-make-fools-us/](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/oct/22/why-free-markets-make-fools-us/)


###Tuesday 20 October
We will do the following: 

- continue with Time chapter
- spend time working on the class exercise to generate graphs for risk averse, risk-loving and risk neutral actors


##Week 6 
###Thursday 15 October

- We will briefly polish one idea from Risk
- We begin Time Preferences (ch. 4)
- We will read a short article
- I hope to show you something new in R very briefly

##Week 5
###Tuesday 6 October
- We continue with Chapter 3 (Risk)

###Thursday 8 October
We'll be doing an R lab today (followed by a quiz online for hand-in the following week).

- Don't forgot to hand in your exercises due today! Hand in on Moodle. 
- Here's the lab: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/Labs/Lab2/Lab2](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/Labs/Lab2/Lab2)

## Week 4
###Thursday 1 October

- We're doing Experiment 2 today. 
- Go to VEconLab here: [http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm](http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm)
- I will give you details on this page that you can use to log in.
- Check out the set of exercises for Chapters 1 to 4 of *Data Computing* here: [simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/exercises/exercises1-4](https://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/exercises/exercises1-4) The exercises will be due online on Moodle on 8 October. 
- The graphic from the experiment is here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=42294](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=42294)
- Here is data from the set of lotteries you chose: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=42295](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=42295)

### Thursday 10 September
Today we shall do an experiment and (if there's time) begin to talk about using R. 

- Go to VEconLab here: [http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm](http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm)
- I will give you details on this page that you can use to log in. 

Experiment Reports

- Guidelines for the reports are available here: [simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/Admin/exp_reports](https://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/Admin/exp_reports)
- The graph from the experiment is here: [drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-cUhfNkItNjlfU00/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-cUhfNkItNjlfU00/view?usp=sharing)
- The data are available in a google spreadsheet here: [docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10xzCd49nOEMDbxmegCfBaFZLz1uYE0ry7zGMBljEUcg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10xzCd49nOEMDbxmegCfBaFZLz1uYE0ry7zGMBljEUcg/edit?usp=sharing)
- The data currently have a 'filter' in the first row and they are filtered on the individual ID codes (1 through 28). You can find your ID code and use the ID code to check what behavior you adopted, i.e. your bid or ask. Your cumulative earnings are also recorded. 
- Screenshots of the instructions are available in a zipped file here: [drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-Vk9PUjZ3WUhlS0U/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-Vk9PUjZ3WUhlS0U/view?usp=sharing).
