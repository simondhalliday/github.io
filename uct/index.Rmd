Here you'll find  the content [Simon Halliday](simondhalliday.github.io) covered during the R for Economics workshop, March 2017. 

We shall start with a presentation by me on R Markdown and some of the uses of R broadly. We will then do a lab exercise, perhaps followed by more activities that employ R Notebooks. 

- Simon's Slides [R Markdown](rmarkdown_reproducibility.html), [Shiny](https://shalliday.shinyapps.io/rmarkdown_reproducibility) (includes the Allen animation) and [Rmd](rmarkdown_reproducibility.Rmd) (no animation)
- A lab to introduce R Studio and R Markdown [html](Lab1.html) and [Rmd](Lab1.Rmd)
- A lab to introduce the tidyverse [html](Lab2.html) and [Rmd](Lab2.Rmd)
- A lab to introduce the plotting [html](Lab3.html) and [Rmd](Lab3.Rmd)
