Practice what you've learned by creating a brief CV of your **fictional alter ego**. 
The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. 
Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. 
Highlight the year in **bold**.

Using the R Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:

- Include an image of yourself (either a local file or url).
- Add a horizontal rule.
- Add a block quote.

Once you've done this, upload the `html` file to the R Markdown workshop folder on OSF that you got access to.
